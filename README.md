## About

A no-thrills no-spills no-frills accordion UI implemented with plain vanilla JavaScript and fat-free; light with no external dependencies.

No embellishments. No configuration. This is not a plugin. Think more shim for the HTML equivalent of an accordion element - if such a thing existed. Non-intrusive. Unopinionated and standards compliant - specifically strictly abides by standard browser behaviours and complies with the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#accordion). WAI-ARIA compliance has been implemented as a separate ES6(ES2015) module and can be removed if so desired without breaking core UI functionality. Similarly the transition mechanics are encapsulated, supported by signposting and intended to be orchestrated exclusively from the donor CSS stylesheets.

Expensive, wasteful and lazy operations are avoided as a matter of principle; e.g. heights are NOT explicitly set and browser resize event is NOT constantly polled. DOM manipulation coverage is limited whenever possible and values reset or defaulted elegantly post-operation. Focus/blur management is handled natively by the correct semantic compositional application of HTML elements removing the overhead of extraneous handling with JavaScript.

Please note: keyboard interactivity involving the up/down arrow and home/end keys to augment tabular navigation have been opted out as these conflict with well established default browser behaviours assigned to these keys correlating to overflow scrolling. The inclusion of these keys are denoted as optional in the spec. This exclusion may be reviewed and revisited at a later stage.

## Example

[Demo - JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/jonathanbrincat/c1h6487k/195/) @v0.0.4

## Install
Install package from NPM into your project dependencies.

```bash
npm install @pix8/ui-accordion --save
```

or

```bash
yarn add @pix8/ui-accordion
```

## Usage
Accordion component is available as a javascript module. `import`, instantiate and consume.

```javascript
import Accordion from "@pix8/ui-accordion";

var $accordion = document.querySelector(".ui__accordion"); // You can use whatever selector and mechanism you so wish

new Accordion($accordion); // Instantiate each accordion instance by passing the relevant HTML DOM node as a parameter 
```

The markup should be structured and furnished with the following descriptive CSS classes i.e. semantic hooks. Please note the choosen elements in this example are purely arbitrary although it is strongly recommended that `ui__toggle` is allied to a `button` element to conform with the WAI-ARIA spec and to correctly attribute focus/blur natively(otherwise with the exception of an `a href`, it would be rendered unsupported).
```html
<dl class="ui__accordion">
	<dt class="ui__tab">
		<button class="ui__toggle">...</button>
	</dt>
	<dd class="ui__pane">
		...
	</dd>

	<dt class="ui__tab">
		<button class="ui__toggle">...</button>
	</dt>
	<dd class="ui__pane">
		...
	</dd>

	...
</dl>
```

(An example is retained in the package directory for guidance)

Styling bundled with this package are discreetly and quite deliberately limited to what is strictly necessary to make an accordion component work and to compliment driven behaviour. Any stylistic overtures should be implemented by the author at the consumption layer i.e. at application/project level - yes this includes any desired transitions and animated effects.

The footprint is kept intentionally minimal to relieve the cognitive investment in consuming this component. There is no configuration object or customisation available or on offer. And I intend to keep it this way. Consuming the accordion component is inspired by conventional and established wisdoms, simultaneous embracing both the KISS and DRY ethos. Why attempt to reinvent the wheel when you should just embrace standard web authoring practise? Makes no sense. Therefore if you want to selectively activate an accordion pane do so on the markup. Either add the enabling class or alternatively the presence of any of the applicable ARIA states will trigger a role of applied intention, and do this for you automagically with javascript. Of course I acknowledge there are limitations to this "Stalinist" approach - most pressing being the inflexibility in prescriptive css class declarations - however I will try to weed out any shortcomings over time.

## Support
Quite frankly I'm not following any mantra here other than following best practise, using my initiative to research specific areas if there is doubt and applying my cool old wise developer's head. There is no bar set other than it should be compatible with most modern web browsers and devices. Such formalities will kill my buzz and bring back haunting memories of ie6/7/8 conformity from my development youth. Please feel free to chip in by launching an ticket on [Github](https://github.com/pix8/ui-accordion/issues) if you encounter an issue. Thanks.


### Possible improvements
* Tidy up and expand upon examples in 'examples' directory
* Dedicated demo/Github page
* Distribute on CDN
* Formulate and write tests
* Closer alignment to the web component spec(custom elements) and possible translation or forking
* Migrate event handling to event delegation
* Expose lifecycle API
* Expose events API
* Persistant active pane for hard refresh or bookmarking(hash url? local storage?)
* Reapply package dependent styles to inline javascript injection on the elements concerned as oppose to internal stylesheet injection
* Seamless integration with MV* libraries - react, vue - removing the need to compose specialised derivatives of the same darn thing

### Future extensions
* Concertina/Collapsible UI variant (shared from same codebase)
* Tabular UI variant (shared from same codebase)
* Toggle functionality/behaviours ringfenced and encapsulated into distinct reusable UI component and retrofitted back in
* Collection of UI components migrated into @pix8/ui-js (possibly as a monorepo)

All I ask in return for publishing and maintaining this module is kudos and respect. ðŸ¤˜ Peace out.
