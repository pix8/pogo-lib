# About

It's an accordion interface. Not much else to say really. Pure, unopinionated, no embellishments and free of dependencies. You do what you please with it. Enjoy!

However... in the grand scheme of things.

Personally this package in it's current guise represents my first intrepid steps towards giving something back to the community and active exposure to the public domain that will help me develop my skills as well as further solidify my knowledge.

This UI component is my first humble efforts to kick start that drive and hopefully I will eventually mould it into something that resembles the work of a professional. And what better choice than an accordion. The chef's omelette to any UI developer's pallet.

The objective is not to break any new ground. The objective is very simple and very resolute. Produce the best damn tasting accordion I can whip up with the ingredients at hand(current serviceable standards and technology). And sprinkle this with pix'ie dust - and when I am satisfied I will start to roll out other UI components to compliment it.
